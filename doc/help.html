<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>This program helps to choose and check Tattslotto numbers.  It is designed for an Australian audience, and supports Tattslotto (Saturday, Monday and Wednesday), X-Lotto, Gold Lotto, Oz Lotto (all states), Lotto Strike (NSW) and Powerball (all states).  This doesn't do Super 66 or 'The Pools', but these games may get supported later.
</p>
<p>
The program generates random numbers and allows you to display them and save them to a file, for marking off on a game card.  You can then later load the numbers, enter the numbers from the draw and instantly determine which divisions you've won, and which games (sequence of numbers) won you that division.  
</p>
<p>
In addition to generating random numbers, you can also add your own to the list (or just use your own numbers without any random ones).
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this program is to make it easy and instant to check your ticket, without having to check it manually or take it to a newsagent.  It also provides you with random numbers to use.

While this program has been tested, no guarantees are made as to the accuracy of its results.  The author takes no responsibility for any loss as a result of use of this program.
</p>
<p>
The files that are saved are plain text files.  Should you wish to print the numbers, simply open up the saved .tatts file in a text editor and print.  Note that for powerball saved games, the last number in each row is the powerball.
