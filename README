automatically generate numbers for a variety of Lotto games which are
available in Australia.  You can save the games, add further your own
selected numbers and check them against the results of the draw,
instantly finding out what games you've won without having to
first check the ticket yourself, or take it to be scanned.  This is
ideal if you want to play the same numbers again and again, and want
to check easily.
